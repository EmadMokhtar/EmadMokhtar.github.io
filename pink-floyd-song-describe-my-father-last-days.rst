Someday I was listened to Pink Floyd song called Wearing inside out from
division bell album and I realized there's apart in lyrics describe the
last days of my father days "In Hospital", he had heart attack.

I miss him soooooooooooooooooooooooo muchÂ 

Here the part:

Look at him now
Hes paler somehow
But hes coming round
Hes starting to choke
Its been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth

\ |Pink Floyd|
