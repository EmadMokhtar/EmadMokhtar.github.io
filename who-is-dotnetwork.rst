`Dotnetwork <http://dotnetwork.org/Home.aspx>`__\  is Egyptian usergroup
which gather for one reason, they interested with .Net Technology, they
lunched in December 11,2007 at Microsoft Egypt building in Smart
Village, I was lucky to be there to feel and experience my first offline
usergroup session/gathering and see a lot of geeks under on roof, some
of them was Microsofter “like googler” such as Stephen Forte, Mohammad
Wahby, and Ahmed Adel.

I attended most of their Monthly gathering and Techday, it’s wonderful
experience to see a lot of people meet in one place to share, discuss,
and learn new IT technology, and I was dream to be a part of this
phenomenal group.

**Group Members:**

#. Remon Zakria (President)
#. Ahmed Ramy.
#. Mohammed M. Mosa.
#. Lames Afifiy.
#. Shimaa Hamdan.
#. Karim Wahba.
#. Peter Bahaa.
#. Hebaa.

**My Experience with Dotnetwork:**

Every gathering or techday i attend the dream grow more and more, until
one day at October’09 gathering which focused on Silverlight 3.0, I made
my fist contact with Ahmed Ramy and we have small chat, and some day
they call for Volunteers to help them organizing the CairoCodeCamp, I
make my mind an said this’s my chance to be part of this group even if
it for short period there’s nothing I can loss.

I send mail to submit myself as volunteer, and Karim Wahba call me for
interview, they accepted me, and we had our first meeting, and now I’m a
member of a wonderful group of volunteers I feel enormous pleasure with
them and I hope we do it perfectly Inshaa Allah.

See You Soon at `CairoCodeCamp <http://www.cairocodecamp.com/>`__, Enjoy
it.
