| Until now I finished 35% of `Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a
  Reckless Upstart into a Visionary
  Leader <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385347405/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385347405&linkCode=as2&tag=monsblo08-20&linkId=2SJY4Q5N7KFZ52DB>`__
  book, and I don’t find Steve Jobs a successful entrepreneur or even a
  leader. Apple's first success because of Apple I which is Steve
  Wozniak idea and engineered by him as well, and Pixar was succeed
  because of its leader not Steve Jobs, in fact Steve Jobs was the
  reason for projects like (Apple III, Macintosh, and NeXT workstations)
  to fail, and was trying to make Pixar the next failure but its leaders
  keep him away and done what they knew it's right for Pixar. In the
  nutshell Steve Jobs is bad micromanager that you shouldn't dream to be
  like him, for me he is a fake leader.
| I’ll continue the book to see How did he turn to be the visionary
  leader after that :)
