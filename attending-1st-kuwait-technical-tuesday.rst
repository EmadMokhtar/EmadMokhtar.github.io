December 28th 2010 I attended the 1st Kuwait Technical Tuesday & the 1st
community event I attend since I start living in Kuwait.

The main theme for this event was “Cloud Computing” specially Microsoft
Windows Azure, it’s 2 sessions event:

#. What is `Microsoft Windows
   Azure <http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/>`__? by Ramon Smit
#. What is `Microsoft Office
   365 <http://office365.microsoft.com/en-US/online-services.aspx>`__?
   by Faisal Al Khatib

The first session was nice but unfortunately there’s a missing hands-on
during session, because the attendees including myself didn’t bring
their notebooks & they did mention it on their FB event page, I hope
next time we’ll have hands-on session for new technologies.

The second session was good & to see online Office 365 project with
`SharePoint <http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx>`__,
`Lync <http://lync.microsoft.com/en-us/launch/Pages/launch.aspx>`__, &
`Exchange <http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/en-us/default.aspx>`__, &
know how it’s how good to be on cloud & have one with your company or
your own project.

It was nice event & I want to thanks all for this event, I hope to see
you guys again & again, & maybe have me as speaker in one of your
sessions.

Thanks guys again & Good luck
