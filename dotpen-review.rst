I bought an iPad Mini 2 to write paper-less/eletronic notes instead of
having notebook and a pen always inside my pockets, I `blogged about it
before <http://www.emadmokhtar.com/2015/12/paperless-notes/>`__, but I
upgraded my stylus from `Moshi Stanza
Duo <http://www.moshi.com/peripheral-stylus-pen-stanza-duo>`__ to
`DotPen <http://dot-tec.com/>`__, and I want to share my experince with
you.

My Experience
=============

    .. rubric:: TL;DR
       :name: tldr

    If you want a stylus that is perfect for hand writing, buy
    `DotPen <http://amzn.to/1OmUCfX>`__.

| I'm using DotPen now for two month, and I'm so happy about it, it feel
  like writing on paper but instead I'm writing on my iPad mini 2, and
  best part that it can support any note taking app, I'm using it with
  GoodNotes and Penultimate and it's perfectly working with them.
| Here is comparison between my handwriting on paper and on iPad using
  dotPen.

Some Features
-------------

-  It's not bluetooth stylus which can sync with apps to enable plam
   rejection feature, so that why I recommned using it with Goodnotes
   becasue of the writing panel.
-  It has On/Off button which I found it's taking it really off, my iPad
   mini 2 can't recognize its tip if it's off.
-  It take AAA battery which can run it for 2 weeks at least, you won't
   change the battery too often because it doesn't have bluetooth which
   it'll not consume the battery.

Other Stylus I tried
====================

I tried `Adonit Jot Touch <http://www.adonit.net/jot/touch/>`__ and I
didn't find it as good as DotPen in writing, and my old Moshi Stanza Duo
wasn't good for hand writing, and I found my self switching back to
paper & pen again and again, but after using DotPen I stopped using
paper and pen.
