In the beginning of every year I say to myself never regret your
mistakes just learn from them, start the new year with fresh thoughts,
new hopes, new dreams, being optimistic, and keep on trying till I reach
the highest ground.

Sometimes looking back on what had happened in the previous year, is
good to know that there are a lot of great things happened, I made a
short list:
