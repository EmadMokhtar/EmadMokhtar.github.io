Hello folks,

Are you once a time misses the attachment file form important? Is this
embarrassing?

I missed an important email attachment and it was CV or resume for job,
it was embarrassing and disappointed, so I Google it and found two
interesting.

-  Missing Attachment PowerToy: work for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007,
   free, only requires simple information and the link will be sent to
   mail.
   [`Link <http://www.fortissoftware.com/Services/ProductDownload.aspx?p=2>`__]
-  Outlook Attachment Reminder: work for both Microsoft Office Outlook
   2007 & 2010 Beta, free, open source, requires .net framework 3.5.
   [`Link <http://oar.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=29682>`__]

I'm using Outlook Attachment Reminder aka OAR with Microsoft Office
Outlook 2010 Beta, it search for a specific word phase in both subject
and/or mail body.
