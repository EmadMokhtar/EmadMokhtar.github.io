There are many features remover or added in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012,
but I'll list the interested ones:

#. X++ code editor removed and replaced with editor like the one used in
   Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
#. X++ reports removed and SSRS reports are the primary reporting tools
   in AX 2012.

   SQL Server 2005 either.
#. You can't view multiple layers in AOT (Application Object Tree).
