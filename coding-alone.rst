Developers and coders are known as anti-social but after many years in
development field, I can tell you this is totally wrong and developers
who can communicate well are good developers they can learn and
understand what they are really doing, if you read soft skills books for
developers, sure you will find chapter about communications and How to
be a part of software development team, but if you can’t communicate
with your teammate you’ll always work lonely and gain nothing more than
loneliness and coding in the dark.

Since I joined the software industry 4+ years, and I’m working, coding,
and developing alone, I read about pair programming in XP “eXtreme
Programming” and daily standup meetings in SCRUM, and How it can
increase the quality and productivity of teams, but I didn’t experience
those, I never pair programming and never being in one of Agile
methodologies, but I’m trying to think with someone else not in the same
team and not a developer, but it worth trying because it’s really
amazing, you’ll feel like you have two extra minds, yes as you read it,
it is like 1 + 1 = 3.

If you watched House M.D. series you will know that Dr. House always
need his team to think with him even if they are away from the right
answer but being there to start a brainstorming and with one simple
unintended input from the team Dr. House can find the solution.

| So I decided that stop working alone and my next gig will be within a
  development team.

And What about you? Do you feel you need to work with a team? Do you
like your team? Or Do you love doing it alone?
