If your lucky and joined `Microsoft

program like mine you’ll have an access to most of Microsoft
professional tools like Visual studio Professional edition, but
unfortunately they’ve closed the program, but don’t worry there’re free
tools you can use which are:

#. `**Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for
   Web** <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40747>`__
   it’s free version of great Microsoft IDE Visual Studio, it’s free but
   it can run unit tests and connect to TFS *(connecting to TFS is neat
   feature and you’ll know why when mention tools number 3).*
#. `**Microsoft WebMatrix
   3** <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286266>`__\ **:** it’s
   light web development tool support ASP.NET, PHP, and Node.js.
#. `**Visual Studio
   Online** <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137&clcid=0x409>`__\ **:**
   it’s Microsoft Team Foundation Server on cloud, imagine you can have
   the full ALM (source control, build server, test server, bug
   tracking, and etc.) system like TFS online free for you and up to 5
   users.
#. `**Microsoft SQL Server 2012
   Express** <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062>`__\ **:**
   it’s free version of Microsoft Database engine and if you choose to
   download and install *Express with Advanced Services* you’ll get
   Express Tools, Reporting Services, and Full Text Search with Database
   Engine for free. You need a database engine on your development
   machine during development as you need to store some data somewhere.

Now you know what are free tools you need to develop ASP.NET
application, let’s see what you need after developing the application.

Hosting
-------

There are three types of hosting:

#. **Shared web hosting service:** Host your website on a server that
   shared between you and other customers, this kind of hosting manger
   through Web Panels, and application can be deployed using Web Deploy
   using Visual Studio.
#. **Virtual private server (VPS):** Host your website on virtual server
   and it’s completely for you only, but it runs on virtual environment.
#. **Dedicated hosting service:** Host your website on physical server,
   like you’re leasing real physical server.
#. **Cloud hosting Services:** Setup and configure your server and it’ll
   be up and run within minutes. and the beauty of the cloud is you pay
   only for you use.

I’ve listed hosting types from lower to higher cost, if you want to
start small try share web hosting and after having money you can invest
in VPS or even more cloud hosting on Microsoft Azure.

License
-------

Microsoft licenses are confused subject for us, but don’t worry you’re
web developer and web are free, so when you developed ASP.NET
application and you want host your application on web, don’t worry the
hosting plan include software licenses for .NET Framework, Windows
Server,  SQL Server, and many software you’ll need or maybe you won’t,
so please don’t worry about the license unless you’ll host you’re
application on premises.
