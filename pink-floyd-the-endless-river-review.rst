| After listening to the album twice, in many songs you can hear the
  sound of The Division Bell album, yeah this one sound like High
  Hopes,  that one sound like Keep Talking,  and the other one sound
  like Come Back To Life. The Endless River is like the CD 2 of The
  Division Bell, and if you listened to David Gilmour and Richard Wright
  solo albums you can hear their music purely in there.
| The Endless River add one more prove that Pink Floyd has its unique
  music and none can create music like this, in other words Pink Floyd
  is legend.
| When you are listening to the album you will find yourself flying and
  psychedelically in other space.
