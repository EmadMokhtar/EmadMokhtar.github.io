|Puzzles|

Sometimes in my life when I face a problem I do everything/mean to solve
it, because the feeling of solving problems is wonderful feeling
specially if you eager to solve problems and puzzles, like the feeling
that `Isaac Newton <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton>`__ had
when he got hit by fallen Apple and discover the notion of gravitation
and said “I find it I find it”.

Or the feeling Tom Hanks/Chuck Noland in `Cast Away
(2000) <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162222/>`__ had when he made a fire
by using wood and said “I made a fire I made a fire”.

If I face a problem anytime I can’t do anything except totally focus on
solving it, usually I forget about anything around me and keep focusing
on solving it, I forget about sleep, food, drink, and even people, All
what I want to solve this little buggy problem.

Now days in work, when I face a problem, I wish there’s more than 8
working hours, because I get a bad feeling when I need to leave the
office and go home, or they will close the work place and leave me there
alone.

For me solving problem or puzzles is more fun and joyful than anything
except one special thing I do every evening (please don’t get me wrong),
I think this’s why I love being geek and programmer.
