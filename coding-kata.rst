Recently I'm reading `Uncle
Bob <http://twitter.com/#!/unclebobmartin>`__'s `Clean Coder
book <http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073>`__
and I read about how a professional programmer must always practice,
like professional musicians, professional football player, and
professional martial arts player. I'm learning  how to play electric
guitar, you need to start slowly "slow will gain speed" start with
something easy and way to go to professional level, and believe me if
you stop practicing you lose your speed, but this doesn't
mean professional guitarist stop learning new things and stop
practicing. When I see a guitarist do something great I ask myself how,
how he did it? the answer is simple he practice.

Getting a job as programmer will not make you a professional one, doing
your work in regular basis won't make you a professional programmer like
walking everyday won't make you a professional athletic, you must
challenge yourself, learning something new, or try to solve problem with
your favorite programming language. Try do practice away from working
time, and practice, practice, practice, practice, and practice.

In `Clean
Coder <http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073>`__'s
Chapter 6 talking about practicing and there's a part talking about
coding kata, so What is Coding Kata?

[quote style="boxed"]Kata is a Japanese word describing detailed
choreographed patterns of movements practised either solo or in pairs.
The term form is used for the corresponding concept in non-Japanese
martial arts in general.[/quote]

**Coding Kata** is solving a small programming problem over and over
again because when you face it or someone like it you don't need that
much effort to think how to solve it, for example professional guitarist
won't think how to do Pull-Offs of Hummer-down when he's playing a solo,
he just thinking about melodies and its harmony, thus professional
programmer will consume most of his/her brain power on how to make this
code clean but on how to solve this simple problem. like in martial arts
they are doing a series of choreographed practice movements so that when
he want to do it he'll get a fast response from his body.

[highlight]I'm new in this, I like the idea, I'll keep practicing, and
I'll keep my moves toward profession.[/highlight]

Here's a video of Uncle Bob preforming coding kata with his audience

Bradbury <http://vimeo.com/dougbradbury>`__ on
