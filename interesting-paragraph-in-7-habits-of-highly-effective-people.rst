|image0|\ Yesterday when I was reading 7 Habits of high Effective
People, I read extremely interesting paragraph in habit no 2 "Begin with
the end in mind" which talk about work-centered people

The paragraph:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Work-centered people may become "workaholics" driving themselves to
    produce at the sacrifice of health, relationships, and other
    important areas of their live. Their fundamental identity comes from
    their work-"I'm a doctor", "I'm a writer", "I'm an actor". Because
    their identity and sense of self-worth are wrapped up in their work,
    their security is vulnerable to anything that happens to prevent
    them from continuing in it. Their wisdom and power come In the
    limited areas of their work, rendering them ineffective in other
    areas of life.

My opinion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

I think he's right most of us "Geeks" can be categorized in this kind of
people. How many of us work in night? Who doesn't work in the weekend?
Who doesn't spend most of his time with machine whatever PC, MAC,
Notebook, Workstation, Servers, etc.?

In other hand if you look and examine the life of the most effective
Geeks in our community, you'll see they spend more time with their
family and friend who can be not a geeky person why not?, they schedule
their time to work in the early morning, organize their tasks, they eat,
sleep, and do some sports to take care of their health.

This paragraph change my paradigm of working and been a workaholic and
ignore important things of my life, actually this book is changing my
life to the better way, It's the most selfhelp/selfdevelopment book I
ever read.
