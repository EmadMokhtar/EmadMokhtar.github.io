I’ve an old PC with Pentium 4 processor, so I want to use it instead of keep it off, so I’ve got an idea to make it Torrent Download Server.

# What does I need to make it Torrent Download Server?

1.  I need a way to connect to it without sitting front, I use Remote Desktop Connection.
2.  Torrent client, I use [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/).
3.  Open port in your Router aka. [Port forwarding](http://portforward.com/).
4.  The Torrent files you want to download, you can get them from many website, but I recommend [btjunkie](http://www.btjunkie.org) [demonoid](http://www.demonoid.com) [torrentz](http://www.torrentz.com) & for series I suggest [eztv](http://eztv.it/)

The main usage of this TDS is downloading my favorite TV series automatically without checking it daily, once the torrent file published on the internet boom the server get it & start to download the new episode,

### So tell me how I can do it? tell me now, hey you tell me how I can do it? OK OK, I’ll tell you the secret right now:

1.  Grab the RSS torrent feed for your favorite series, for example let’s say The Big Bang Theory:
    -   Go to [ezrss](http://www.ezrss.it/) search for [The Big Bang Theory](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/) & make sure to test the search result to get the required show and quality.
    -   After grabbing the series' torrent [RSS feed](http://www.ezrss.it/search/index.php?show_name=The+Big+Bang+Theory&show_name_exact=true&date=&quality=&release_group=&mode=rss) copy the link.
    -   Open uTorrent & Add RSS feed, give it Custom Alias, & choose if you want to download the feed manually or automatically.![rssfeed]({filename}/images/rssfeed_1.jpg)
    -   Now you’ll have a RSS feed for the series’ episodes.![rssfeedutorrent]({filename}/images/rssfeedutorrent.jpg)

2.  Set the schedule to download, in case if you’re not using the
    internet connection only by yourself, you can use uTorrent schedule
    to download in idle time.
    -   Go to uTorrent –&gt; Options –&gt; Preferences (Ctrl + P) –&gt; Scheduler [![utorrentscheduler]({filename}/images/utorrentscheduler.jpg)
    -   Choose the idle time that none is using the connection, like her I set it at the “In Work Time” so I’m setting there on my desk & downloading the new episode [House MD](http://www.fox.com/house/) like there’s a ghost of me in the house booooooooooo.

That’s it, Enjoy & happy watching.
