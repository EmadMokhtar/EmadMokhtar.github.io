I attended Django Under The Hood 2016, in sprints there is a comment passing around which [Django is boring](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2016/12/14/django-boring-or-why-tech-startups-should-use-django/). Django is boring is actually a good news for the framework users, but it's sad one for developers want to contribute to the framework.

Every time I go to check [Django tickets](https://code.djangoproject.com/) to contribute, I found they are difficult and in depth, because Django is a mature project now and the amount of contribution needed to the codebase is rare, but if you want to contribute you can check [easy pickings](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=!closed&easy=1) tickets. In DUTH before the sprints projects leaders start to ask attendees for contributions, I found this is a good opportunity for me and for anyone wants to help the community and start to contribute to Django community.

If you want to contribute to Django and help the community, I have some suggestions for you:

1. Write blog posts on How-tos, tips, and tutorials for Django, and [Django packages](https://djangopackages.org/) for example Django REST Framework.
2. Help Django team to [move the ticket from stage to another](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/internals/contributing/triaging-tickets/#triage-workflow).
3. Contribute to one of Django’s packages, specially packages you are using, check their github page and help them.
4. Tried more than one package for X? Perfect write Why you picked this over other, and please be gentle we are helping the community.

Django is boring because it’s a mature framework, and I’m enjoying using it, every day I’m learning new things in Django, and trying to help the best community I ever joined. I’m so proud to be part of this community.
