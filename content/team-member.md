## The Start

In September 2017 I left my job and my life in [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait) and traveled to the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) to join [Veneficus](https://veneficus.nl/en/) as Software developer, one of the reasons I moved to the Netherlands is I want to work in a team and I started to feel being a [solo developer]({filename}/Solo Developer.md) is bad for my career.

I joined a team of 7 developers mixed between full-time and  part-time, and start to fell there are some missing skills I need to develop, and yes it was correct I worked alone for almost 7 years, what is meaning working alone, it means no need for communication, no need for development plans, no need for technical debate, no need to manage your time or other team member's time. In the beginning, I feel so bad and stressed with that I made many mistakes, to be honest, but with a growth mindset you need to learn from my mistakes and grow and fix them, os what I did?
