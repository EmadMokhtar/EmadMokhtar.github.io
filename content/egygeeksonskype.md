Hello Folks,

![Skype Slogan]({static}/images/features_bnr_skypeRequires.110142655.jpg)

Yesterday I enjoy the first **EgyGeeksOnSkype** meeting with **Ayman El
Hattab, Mohamed Meligy, Ramy Mahrous, Doha El Sayed, Nashwa, and Amr El
Dieb**.

# How did it happen?

First, we were tweeting about where we'll spend our holiday on Twitter, and I felt dizzy because Twitter don't include threads and you try to trace the conversation, so I invited them to go to a chat room on TinyChat.com, and we try to chat with voice, technically it was bad experience, so I suggest to transfer this conversation to Skype, and we did.

Then Mohamed Meligy "inspiring of sarajchipps idea" suggest we make this meeting weekly meeting and we called it EgyGeeksOnSkype.

# What did happen on Skype?

We spend 3 hours on Skype, talking about technical and non-technical stuff, but it was awesome conversation I ever have, we all geeks and share common ideas.

# Where, When, and How can I join you?

## How It's so simple
and super easy, First think you must have is Skype client and account,

We will decide every week what is the topic on the next week, so next Friday April 9th, First Ayman El Hattab 'SharePoint MVP' will make a demo for us about **No-Code SharePoint Solution** for one hour, and then we will have open discussion on the **Microsoft OData** technology.

Thanks folks, and I yearn to meet you next Friday, see you there
