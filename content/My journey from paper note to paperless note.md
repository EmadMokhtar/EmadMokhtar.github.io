I really love to take notes wherever and wheneve. I like to keep my notes with me, but after buying iPad mini I decide to change my note tool from paper notes to paperless notes (e-notes), but I like to hand writing my notes I want something that feels like paper notes.



### Searching for the tool



I thought of buying a stylus for iPad that feels like real pen and start taking notes, first I found [fiftythree Pencil](https://www.fiftythree.com/pencil) but it was built mainly for designers not for writing, then I found The best stylus for me is the [Jot Script](http://www.adonit.net/jot/script/) but it is expensive but it has the best writing experience and best accuracy. This is for the stylus, for the application I searched about note application that can enhance my writing accuracy, I found two note apps:





  * [Penultimate Evernote](http://evernote.com/penultimate/)


    * Free



    * Sync with Evernote


    * Zoom in and write with line recognition




  * [Goodnotes](http://www.goodnotesapp.com/)



    * Paid  (but worth every penny)


    * Backup with most of cloud storages like Google Driver, Dropbox, & OneDrive.  



    * Pen size & color customization.  



    * Palm rest and palm rejection.  

    * Add annotations to PDF files.


    * Writing panel.


    * Shape recognition.
