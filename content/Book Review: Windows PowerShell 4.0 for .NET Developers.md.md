My academic colleague [Sherif Talaat](http://www.sheriftalaat.com/)
released his second book [Windows PowerShell 4.0 for .NET
Developers](http://www.packtpub.com/windows-powershell-4-0-for-dotnet-developers/book)
which is filling the gap between .NET Developers and Administration tool
like Windows PowerShell, before reading this book I was having small
information about PowerShell and I didn’t know it’ll help me in my
development tasks. Target audiences of this book are .NET Developers.

# Chapter 1: Getting Started with Windows PowerShell

It’s an introduction chapter with very basic information about
PowerShell and the scripting environments.

# Chapter 2: Unleashing Your Development Skills with PowerShell

From this chapter things start to get real and you’ll find script to do
some job like Create .NET Object, parse and query XML files, create
modules, etc..

# Chapter 3: PowerShell for Your Daily Administration Tasks

Where things getting more excitement, in this chapter you will learn how
to use execute PowerShell *cmdlet*s remotely on other machine, execute
your script as workflow, use PowerShell with SQL SERVER and IIS
(Internet Information Services), and last but not least manage local
users and groups with PowerShell.

# Chapter 4: PowerShell and Web Technologies

In this chapter you’ll see that PowerShell can deal with Web Services
SOAP or REST, download file form Web, and as PowerShell can work with
XML it also can work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

# Chapter 5: PowerShell and Team Foundation Server

In the last chapter you’ll learn that PowerShell is like GitHub Bash for
TFS (Team Foundation Server).

# Conclusion:

I really enjoy reading this book but unfortunately it missing a
reference to parameters/cases, for example is IIS part it’ll show you
how to change AppPool properties using PowerShell but not all cases
included and no links, but overall I give this book 4 starts.
