Today when I was waiting for the band of Tanora Show to get started, I wrote this poetry for someone special.

She SEO my life  

She turns my 0'z to 1'z  

She nudges my feelings  

She is my RSS of my life  

If you Google my heart you'll find her  

She is a Hashtag of my soul  

She is a Love entity in my HeartDB  

She is system file of my memory  

She is a Silverlight of my future  

She autocomplete my thoughts  

She ReadyBoost my motivation  

And I Favorite/Bookmark here
