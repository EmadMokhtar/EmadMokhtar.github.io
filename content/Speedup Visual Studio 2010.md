Every time I finished installing Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 on my machines I Google “Speedup Visual Studio 2010”, so for time sake I’m gathering the effective links in one place as reference to me and to anyone out there.

# Notes

-   Some of those links have tips for Visual Studio 2008 but still work on Visual Studio 2010
-   Some of those links have tip to disable Resharper for myself I will never do this, I love Resharper and I cannot take the risk to disable it to speed up my Visual Studio 2010.
-   In link no. 2 it is says for Beta 2 but work with RTM and SP1, and please look at the comment I left there.
