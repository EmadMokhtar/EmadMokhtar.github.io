We keep running in the same freakin loop/circle & forget
pursuiting/catch our dreams and goals, and just stick to little small
useless life events.

Sometimes we invent things to take them as excuses like money, time,
children, place, or company. Manage yourself and take guidance from
Allah, fix your issues aka & "excuses" , have a dream no no have a lot
of dreams and live your life to catch the and make them true.

Ask yourself every morning, Am I like what I'm doing? If no please quit
it and go live your life and search about what you are like to do and
start living it, one day shorter breathe and here come the death
