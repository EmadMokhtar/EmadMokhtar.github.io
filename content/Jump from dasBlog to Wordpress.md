In my start into blogging I start to blog on [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) from hosting blog, I like it but after blogging many posts I found it has many limitations, so I decided to get self hosted blog engine, I searched for many blog engines and I inspired with[Scott Hanselman's blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) and downloaded [dasBlog engine](http://dasblog.codeplex.com/), hosted it locally, and start the journey of customizing and configuration, I wasn't as easy as it sounds, you must get your hand dirty with CSS, ASP.NET, JavaScript, and XML configuration files, but after 2 weeks I got it up and working. After a while I realized I want more fixable blog engine, start searching and found [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) my old engine but the self hosted one is the most common blog used on the internet, even my buddy [Mohammed Meligy](http://twitter.com/#!/meligy "@Meligy") once a while decided to use wordpress as [his blog](http://gurustop.net/) engine. Decision has been made and it's time to buy PHP hosting instead of .NET one and install Wordpress; it took me 4\~5 days to complete this setup but if you subtract the 2 days I spent in searching for the suitable theme, the total is 2\~3 days to step my wordpress blog, so what did I do in this setup?

-   Buy hosting plan
-   Install & configure Wordpress
-   Install & configure theme
-   Migrate old posts
-   Upload old media
-   Install & configure plug-ins
-   Configure [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/ "feedburner") & [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics "Google Analytics")

After all I'm so happy with Wordpress, I'll keep my blog in here and will never change my engine again to apply this rule of [Scott Hanselamn's 32 rules to make your blog suckless](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlogInteresting32WaysToKeepYourBlogFromSucking.aspx):

> **Avoid Split Brain -  Pick a Blog and Stay There**
>
> -   Avoid maintaining two blogs. It's just as tacky, if not more so,
>     as having 5 phone numbers on your business card. It makes it
>     hard to find you, and your two blogs will always be fighting each
>     other on Google, splitting your virtual  personality.
