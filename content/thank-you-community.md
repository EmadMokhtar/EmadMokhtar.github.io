November 2015 [I left my comfort zone, and I started my journey with Python](http://emadmokhtar.com/net-developer-comfort-zone.html#net-developer-comfort-zone), it was not an easy start. I was a Windows/Microsoft guy, I was using Microsoft Visual Studio on a daily basis, and Windows was my primary OS.  I switched to macOS and Pycharm; I picked these to make my transition easier than using Linux (Ubuntu) and Vim.

After 2 months of figuring out what are virtualenv, pip, python version, and environment variable. I started another milestone of how to write a pythonic code while that I went to [DjangoCon](http://emadmokhtar.com/djangocon-europe-2016-me-and-django-sprints.html#djangocon-europe-2016-me-and-django-sprints), and I saw how awesome this community is. WOW 🤗, this community is very welcoming for newcomers, and since this day I'm in ❤️ with this community.

Like someone said to me "You are staying because of people not because of  the language." Indeed, the community is excellent 👍🏻, and it is what makes this language impressive and always adopting the future.

I want to thank all human beings in this community form leaders to the starters (welcome BTW 😉), thank you for being a part of this community and making this community.
