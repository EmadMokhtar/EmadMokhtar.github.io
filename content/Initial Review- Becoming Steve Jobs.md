Until now I finished 35% of [Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385347405/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385347405&linkCode=as2&tag=monsblo08-20&linkId=2SJY4Q5N7KFZ52DB) book, and I don’t find Steve Jobs a successful entrepreneur or even a leader. Apple's first success because of Apple I which is Steve Wozniak idea and engineered by him as well, and Pixar was succeed because of its leader not Steve Jobs, in fact Steve Jobs was the reason for projects like (Apple III, Macintosh, and NeXT workstations) to fail, and was trying to make Pixar the next failure but its leaders keep him away and done what they knew it's right for Pixar. In the nutshell Steve Jobs is bad micromanager that you shouldn't dream to be like him, for me he is a fake leader.  
I’ll continue the book to see How did he turn to be the visionary leader after that :)
