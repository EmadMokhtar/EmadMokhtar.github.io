|orchard2|\ |Orchard1|\ Today I’ve decided to use
`Orchard <http://www.orchardproject.net>`__ to build a site, but before
getting deeper let me quote What is Orchard?

    Orchard is a **free, open source, community-focused** project aimed
    at delivering applications and reusable components on the ASP.NET
    platform.

    Orchard will create shared components for building ASP.NET
    applications and extensions, and specific applications that leverage
    these components to meet the needs of end-users, designers,
    developers, and Web professionals. Additionally, we seek to create
    partnerships with existing application authors to help them achieve
    their goals. Orchard is delivered as part of the `ASP.NET Open
    Source
    Gallery <http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery.aspx>`__
    under the `Outercurve Foundation <http://www.outercurve.org/>`__. It
    is licensed under a `New BSD
    license <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php>`__,
    which is approved by the OSI.

I know after reading some question & discussion about whether I go for
Orchard or `Umbraco <http://umbraco.com/>`__, you can search on
`StackOvreflow <http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=orchard+%2B+umbraco>`__
and will find thousands or question about this; I take a decision to go
for Orchard & I know it’s like entering a dark cave, but I don’t know
when I’ll take my first step in there once I hear strange voice in there
I’ll run back out, or I’ll brave enough to continue discover this dark
cave, if it’ll be subway to Hawaii or I’ll see a monster in there.

This doesn’t mean I hate Umbraco or I love Orchard more, I just want to
take adventure of trying Orchard, but there’s time I’ll get my hand
dirty with Umbrco. 

I’ll update you with my experience form time to time.
