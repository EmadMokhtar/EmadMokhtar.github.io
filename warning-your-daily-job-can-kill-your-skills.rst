Software developer daily job full of To-Do tasks, we are getting things
done on daily basis in order to get the project done in the estimated
time as much as possible. For me I’m working with web technologies and
most of my daily tasks is related to building Line Of Business
applications “LOB”. One day I went to CodeEval and try to solve some
puzzles posted there by my code, and suddenly I found that I lost one of
my skills.

The Shock
---------

It took me long time to figure out how to solve easy puzzle. When I was
in collage studying computer science I was facing similar puzzles and
much harder ones and I was good at it my mind was trained to solve them
even without code editor, I was solving them with pen and paper, even
sometimes teaching assistants were challenging us to solve hard puzzles
to get bonus scores, it was fun and challenging, but after joining a job
as software developer I though this skill will remain there in my mind
and it’ll increase while gaining the working experience, but I found out
this skill is not in my daily job, and I’m losing it from the day I
stopped to solve puzzles because no one will add a task to get the
intersection of two arrays in your task list or iteration.

Gain It Back
------------

After find I lost my skill I start to solve puzzles on CodeEval and gain
the problem solving skill again, it’ll get you out of boredom as well,
so please set a side time for this, you need problem solving skill and
you can't get a job without it, I’ve done many job interviews and they
are full of puzzles because companies are searching for a developer who
can think how to solve a problem not to build Customer Model.

What To Do?
-----------

| Set a side time to solve puzzles and don’t be upset if you find it’s
  hard in the beginning, keep trying and you’ll gain it more and more.
| Join of code puzzles websites, I personally using
  `CodeEval <https://www.codeeval.com>`__ "`join
  me <http://www.codeeval.com/profile/emadmokhtar/>`__\ ” and start
  solving problems and gain points.
