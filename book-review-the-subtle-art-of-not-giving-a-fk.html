<p>Last month I had small trip to Netherlands, Rotterdam, at night I went to have a dinner with friends at <a href="http://www.euromast.nl/en">EuroMast</a>, it was windy day, we putted our bags in my friend‚Äôs car trunk, but unfortunately someone broken inside the car and took 2 bags and one of them was my bag. My travel backpack is stolen and I lost most of my gadgets (MacBook Pro, iPad, Amazon Kindle, Wallet, etc..)</p>
<p>After a night at the police station to report the incident, I went to hotel to get some sleep before flying back to home, next day I woke up, prepared my bags and headed to airport, but on my way to the airport I was thinking what to do during my long flight, I thought let‚Äôs read a book, so once I reached the airport I went to bookstore and bought <a href="http://amzn.to/2nmdr0B">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</a>.</p>
<p>So Emad, Why you are telling us these story? Because while I'm reading this book I found this part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don't always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how er respond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is what I need to understand and realize after I lost my bag, and that is why I told you my story, I bought this book in the right time.</p>
<p>I read half of the book during my flight and I was amazed of life changing ideas and philosophy from the author, specially after I lost most of my gadgets and thinking how to react about this and what to do next (which is something discussed in the book).</p>
<p>The book is full of paradigm shifts, so please read and take what you liked from the book and just be open minded about what you don‚Äôt like, the author himself ask the reader the same.</p>
<p>The core message in the book is to change your life priorities and really give a f**k, focus, and care about these things and ignore other things.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll give it 10/10 üëçüèª, it‚Äôs really beautiful book and it‚Äôs the fastest book I ever read till now.</p>
