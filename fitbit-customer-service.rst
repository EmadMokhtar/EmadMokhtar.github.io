The start
---------

I received Fitbit Flex as my birthday gift from my wife and I joined
Fitbit community since 2013, I love the device and I love the sleep
tracking feature, and with this feature now I can know why I'm feeling
sleepy by data.

First Issue
-----------

Less than one year of using my Fitbit Flex, it started to not charging,
and vibrating for alarms and feedback, so I created a support issue on
Fibit support portal, and the quick answer was, Oh we are sorry please
give us an address so we can send you another one. I got shocked, this
reminded me of Amazon Customer Service quality.

Second Issue
------------

After receiving the second Fitbit Flex, I used it for while and the
wristband got damaged, I created a support issue again, they request a
confirmation that my band is damaged, I replied with images, and boom
the same response "Oh we are sorry please give us an address so we can
send you another one".

Third Issue
-----------

My replacement Fitbit Flex got damaged also and again I created support
issue, and this time they were more awesome than before, they sent me a
replacement though my warranty is expired, Can you believe it?

Searching for another tracker
-----------------------------

| After my Fitbit Flex got broken for the third time, I thought I'll buy
  new tracker and it won't be Fitbit Flex (There is an issue with the
  tracker that can't stand for 1 year) so I compared Apple Watch, Peddle
  Time Watch, Fitbit Surge, and Fitbit Charge HR.
| Apple Watch and Peddle Time are watches with activity tracking, and
  Fitbit Surge and Fitbit Charge HR are activity trackers with watch
  faces.

`Apple Watch <https://www.apple.com/watch/>`__

Apple Watch has its own Heath app and tracking your activity and with
thrid party you can sync these data to your Fitbit account, but for me
Apple Watch is expensive and fancy, so No.

`Peddle Time <https://www.pebble.com/pebble-time-smartwatch-features>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After I made my mind and orderd my new tracker they implement `activity
tracking inside Peddle Time
Watch <http://www.forbes.com/sites/bradmoon/2015/12/16/pebble-health-pebble-time-smartwatch-gains-native-activity-and-sleep-tracking/>`__
but for me I love Fitbit community and I have friends more there, so No.

`Fitbit Surge <http://www.fitbit.com/surge>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|Fitbit-Surge|

It's very nice tracker but with its size I can't take it with me to bed
and this is one of the main feature I bought Fitbit Flex for, so sorry
buy No.

`Fitbit Charge HR <http://www.fitbit.com/chargehr>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|e16f2610-4ebc-486c-9b3b-37a51b5612e6.\_V330045372\_\_SR285,285\_|

Yes, I order Fitbit Charge HR because it has all what I want:

#. Watch Face.
#. Automatic Sleep Tracking.
#. Comfortable Size.
#. Fitbit community.
#. The Awesome Fitbit customer service.
#. Log battery life.
#. Heart beat tracking.

In Nut Shell
------------

| In nutshell I adore Fitbit customer service and with this quality of
  service I decide not to leave them and give a try for Fitbit Charge
  HR, and till now I love it.
| Wait for my review about it soon.
