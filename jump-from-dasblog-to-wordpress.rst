| In my start into blogging I start to blog on
  `wordpress.com <http://wordpress.com/>`__ from hosting blog, I like it
  but after blogging many posts I found it has many limitations, so I
  decided to get self hosted blog engine, I searched for many blog
  engines and I inspired with\ `Scott Hanselman's
  blog <http://www.hanselman.com/blog/>`__ and downloaded `dasBlog
  engine <http://dasblog.codeplex.com/>`__, hosted it locally, and start
  the journey of customizing and configuration, I wasn't as easy as it
  sounds, you must get your hand dirty with CSS, ASP.NET, JavaScript,
  and XML configuration files, but after 2 weeks I got it up and
  working.
| After a while I realized I want more fixable blog engine, start
  searching and found `Wordpress <http://wordpress.org/>`__ my old
  engine but the self hosted one is the most common blog used on the
  internet, even my buddy `Mohammed
  Meligy <http://twitter.com/#!/meligy>`__ once a while decided to use
  wordpress as `his blog <http://gurustop.net/>`__ engine.
| Decision has been made and it's time to buy PHP hosting instead of
  .NET one and install Wordpress; it took me 4~5 days to complete this
  setup but if you subtract the 2 days I spent in searching for the
  suitable theme, the total is 2~3 days to step my wordpress blog, so
  what did I do in this setup?

-  Buy hosting plan
-  Install & configure Wordpress
-  Install & configure theme
-  Migrate old posts
-  Upload old media
-  Install & configure plug-ins
-  Configure `FeedBurner <http://www.feedburner.com/>`__ & `Google
   Analytics <http://www.google.com/analytics>`__

After all I'm so happy with Wordpress, I'll keep my blog in here and
will never change my engine again to apply this rule of `Scott
Hanselamn's 32 rules to make your blog
suckless <http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlogInteresting32WaysToKeepYourBlogFromSucking.aspx>`__:

    **Avoid Split Brain -  Pick a Blog and Stay There**

    -  Avoid maintaining two blogs. It's just as tacky, if not more so,
       as having 5 phone numbers on your business card. It makes it
       hard to find you, and your two blogs will always be fighting each
       other on Google, splitting your virtual  personality.
