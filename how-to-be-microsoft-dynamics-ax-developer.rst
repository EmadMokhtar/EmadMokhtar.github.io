Do you want to be Microsoft Dynamics AX Developer? I assume you are.
Learn how to develop on Microsoft Dynamics AX is not as easy as it
seems, it is not as easy as learning to developer using other platforms
like Microsoft SharePoint. The material provided from Microsoft is not
that one will give you the full picture about the platform, it will give
you only the guidelines and you have to go and search and search and
search and search. It took me 2 full years to know what I knew now, it
is not much but I can do many things not included in the documentations.

So I decided to write this article to make it short on new developers
whom want to learn about developing with Microsoft Dynamics AX and even
help whom already Microsoft Dynamics AX developers.

The Platform:
=============

Programming Language:
---------------------

Microsoft Dynamics AX is built with its programming language called
`**X++** <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%2B%2B#MorphX_and_X.2B.2B>`__,
it is like C++, C#, or Java, it is Object Oriented, if you know one of
these languages you will be familiar with X++.

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) :
------------------------------------------

Microsoft Dynamics AX has its own IDE called
`MorphX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MorphX#MorphX_and_X.2B.2B>`__, you
will use it during all your development tasks, it is very easy and
support drag and drop to make developer life easier but from my opinion
the only cons is it is not supporting multi-monitor, you need to work in
one window in one monitor, it is not like Visual Studio you can drag the
Toolbox bar and drop it to other monitor.

The Journey:
------------

I started by reading the `Microsoft Student Training
Document <https://mbs.microsoft.com/CMS/Templates/site/DLPP.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRNODEGUID=%7bC4BA7F45-1232-4A4C-906D-E37D7305B2CE%7d&NRORIGINALURL=%2fpartnersource%2fcommunities%2ftraining%2ftrainingmaterials%2fstudent&NRCACHEHINT=Guest>`__
you need to have access to Microsoft Partner Source or Customer Source,
then start to develop and found out these documents is not enough and I
need to learn something more, I started to Googling or Binging and land
on small parts that are helping but you need to add yours to make it
full solution, for example I need to create a Sales Order and Sales Line
from the code, I found sample code to create one using job (Job in AX is
small runnable code) not how to use it inside a form whether to
implement it in Class, Form, or Table, and if you will implement it in
Form in which level DataSource or Design, I was confused and none on web
can help me in setting things together till I found this great free book
called `MorhpX
IT <http://www.steenandreasen.com/index.php?page=morphx-it>`__ it was
written for AX 4.0 but it still have useful information works with AX
2012 R2 I encourage you to read it after reading Student Training
Documents, I really got the full picture of the platform and now I feel
like I’m understand what I’m doing.
