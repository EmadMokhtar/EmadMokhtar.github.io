Hello folks,\ |image0|

I'm writing this post because I'll travel to Kuwait to start my career
there, I hope I'll make it in the best way, and please wish me good
luck.

Good bye black sky, good bye traffic jams, good bye chaos, and good bye
Egypt.

I'm leaving Egypt, Cairo, and leaving with them my best friends ever, my
memories (good and bad), the best IT community ever, my geek friends,
and very special person.

Leaving this special person like leaving a piece of my heart here in
Egypt, so I'll get back and collect it ASAP, none can live without this
piece.

In the last year here in Egypt I done a lot of activity like volunteered
in Cairo CodeCamp 2010 and the Visual Studio 2010 community lunch, met
new wonderful friends; I hope I can do the same in Kuwait.

So Good bye my friends I wish you the best and see you in the best
state.

Best Regards,

Emad Mokhtar
