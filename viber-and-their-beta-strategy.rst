|viber|\ In 2 months `Viber <http://www.viber.com/>`__ was planning to
release Beta version of their Android app for the volunteers to test it,
I submitted for it and I’ve shock when they asked for my mobile phone
model, yes they asked the manufacturer and the model, but they delayed
this release because they were busy in releasing the 2.0 iPhone version
which include the messaging/texting.

Finally they’d released it, and I didn’t wait for email notification, I
went to their `Viber for Android download
page <http://www.viber.com/download>`__, downloaded the
.\ `apk <http://s3.amazonaws.com/Viber-Android-Beta/viber.apk>`__ file
on my mobile phone which is HTC Desire HD.

The version was so bad and had many buggy behaviors, I know it’s a beta
version and it’s normal plus they gave it to us to  help them in testing
not just use it, and this what I like the most, like as Viber telling us
we are providing a free of charge VOIP services and want it to be
cross-platform application so please Android user help us by test our
application for free, OK Viber I’ll test it and help you to improve it
which is so true the last couple versions is so stable and the call
voice quality is awesome.

Thanks Viber |Winking smile|
