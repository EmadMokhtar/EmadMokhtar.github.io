| I really love to take notes wherever and wheneve. I like to keep my
  notes with me, but after buying iPad mini I decide to change my note
  tool from paper notes to paperless notes (e-notes), but I like to hand
  writing my notes I want something that feels like paper notes.

Searching for the tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I thought of buying a stylus for iPad that feels like real pen and start
taking notes, first I found `fiftythree
Pencil <https://www.fiftythree.com/pencil>`__ but it was built mainly
for designers not for writing, then I found The best stylus for me is
the `Jot Script <http://www.adonit.net/jot/script/>`__ but it is
expensive but it has the best writing experience and best accuracy. This
is for the stylus, for the application I searched about note application
that can enhance my writing accuracy, I found two note apps:

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li>

`Penultimate Evernote <http://evernote.com/penultimate/>`__

-  Free
-  Sync with Evernote
-  Zoom in and write with line recognition

.. raw:: html

   </li>
   <li>

`Goodnotes <http://www.goodnotesapp.com/>`__

.. raw:: html

   </li>

-  Paid (but worth every penny)
-  Backup with most of cloud storages like Google Driver, Dropbox, &
   OneDrive.
-  Pen size & color customization.
-  Palm rest and palm rejection.
-  Add annotations to PDF files.
-  Writing panel.
-  Shape recognition.

.. raw:: html

   </li>
   </ul>
