Fishbowl the windows-based facebook client from UXlab@Microsoft,they
build it by using `Facebook
SDK <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ee388574.aspx>`__ and the
Microsoft Winodows Presentation Foundation aka WPF, it's opensoruce
project where's `the project codeplex

**Conclusion:** Fishbowl is the best and first Facebook windows client
and has reach the optimal user experience with WPF technology, i can't
leave it, now Facebook online just only for messages, events, groups,
and activity like friend requests.

I recommend to download and try it
`Fishbowl <http://www.fishbowlclient.com/GetFishbowl.exe>`__, but first
look at the `System
requirements. <http://www.fishbowlclient.com/SystemRequirements.htm>`__
