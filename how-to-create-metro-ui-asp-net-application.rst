If you’re ASP.NET developer, you’re concern about the User
Interface/Design of your application and you notice Metro/Modern UI is
neat and great UI, but How I can make my ASP.NET application look like
Windows 8 application? Can I do that? The answer is Yes you can,
there’re bunch of (free/paid) tools that will help in make your ASP.NET
application looks like Windows 8 application.

Before listing the tools, let’s see Why Metro/Modern UI is neat? and Why
Microsoft choose it to be its UI cross all its platforms? Microsoft
Modern/Metro UI inspired by public transportation signs and it’s a
typography design which focus on the content by implement typography
more than graphics.

My Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Personally I didn’t use Windows 8 yet, I’ve tired it but I didn’t use it
as my daily OS. Last week I bought `Nokia Lumia
920 <http://www.nokia.com/mea-en/products/phone/lumia920>`__ and What
made my mind to buy it and go for Windows Phone after using Android for
2 years? It’s the UI and UX, yes Microsoft made it this time. Me and my
wife were shopping, we went to try this phone and she said wow this UI
and UX are great (she's an Apple fan) and I agree with he. I’m using the
phone for a week only and I love it.

Modern UI or Metro UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you noticed I’m using Metro/Modern UI not Metro only, because
Microsoft forced to change the name of its new UI to Modern because of
some legal issues and copyrights, it’s rumor but the true is Microsoft
stop calling it Metro and mention it as “Microsoft design language” and
some folks on the internet call it Modern UI.

The List (Tools)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your ASP.NET will have a great UI if you add Metro UI to it, so let’s
list the tools:

-  **CSS/JavaScript:**

   -  `Metro UI CSS <http://metroui.org.ua/>`__ (free): It’s CSS
      framework helps you create most of the things in Metro/Modern UI
      components like live tiles, toggles, textboxes, buttons, and much
      much more, it has its grid system and it’s not based Twitter
      Bootstrap.
   -  `Bootmetro <http://aozora.github.com/bootmetro/>`__ (free): It’s
      based on Twitter Bootstrap so you still have features of bootstrap
      and has some of Metro UI components like hub/tile. action buttons,
      notifications, list view. etc..
   -  `Metro-bootstrap <http://talkslab.github.com/metro-bootstrap/index.html>`__
      (free): It’s also based on Twitter Bootstrap but it’s lack of many
      Metro/Modern UI components.

-  **Icons:**

   -  `Syncfusion Metro
      Studio <http://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio>`__
      (free): It’s free  desktop application that have more than 1700
      icons you’ll need when building Metro/Modern application, the
      great thing about this tool is you can arrange icons in projects,
      export icons to many extension or ever `CSS
      sprites <http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp>`__,
      and resize icons.
   -  `MetroUIIcons.com <http://modernuiicons.com/>`__ (free): It’s a
      website contains more than 800 handcrafted Metro UI icons, the
      create thing about this website that you can contribute because
      it’s open source and hosted on
      `GitHub <https://github.com/Templarian/WindowsIcons/>`__ plus you
      can make a request for an Icon.

-  **ASP.NET Control**:

   -  `Telerik ASP.NET Ajax
      RadControls <http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx>`__
      (paid): Telerik is the one of the best companies that provide .NET
      tools/controls to .NET developers, it has RadControls for ASP.NET
      WebForms, one of the best feature of RadControls is the style,
      Telerik provides wide rang of styles with RadControls so
      developers can use them out of the box. Two of RadControls styles
      are Metro which looks like Metro/Modern UI and Metro Touch which
      is a touch enabled version of Metro/Modern UI.

What I’m using
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Personally I’m using Metro UI CSS, Syncfusion Metro Studio, and Telerik
ASP.NET Ajax RadContorls, it’s working fine together not perfect because
there’re some CSS conflicts between Metro UI CSS and Telerik ASP.NET
Ajax RadContorls, but in the other hand it’s working, nowadays I’m
working on an ASP.NER WebForms application with those 3 tools to make it
looks like Windows 8 application.
