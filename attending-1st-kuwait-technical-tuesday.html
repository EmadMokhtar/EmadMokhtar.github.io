<p>On December 28th 2010 I attended the 1st Kuwait Technical Tuesday &amp; the 1st community event I attend since I start living in Kuwait.</p>
<p>The main theme for this event was “Cloud Computing” specially Microsoft
Windows Azure, it’s 2 sessions event:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/">Microsoft Windows
    Azure</a>? by Ramon Smit</li>
<li>What is <a href="http://office365.microsoft.com/en-US/online-services.aspx">Microsoft Office
    365</a>? by
    Faisal Al Khatib</li>
</ol>
<p>The first session was nice but unfortunately there’s a missing hands-on during session, because the attendees including myself didn’t bring their notebooks &amp; they did mention it on their FB event page, I hope next time we’ll have hands-on session for new technologies.</p>
<p>The second session was good &amp; to see online Office 365 project with <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a>, <a href="http://lync.microsoft.com/en-us/launch/Pages/launch.aspx">Lync</a>, &amp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/en-us/default.aspx">Exchange</a>, &amp; know how it’s how good to be on cloud &amp; have one with your company or your own project.</p>
<p>It was nice event &amp; I want to thanks all for this event, I hope to see you guys again &amp; again, &amp; maybe have me as speaker in one of your sessions.</p>
<p>Thanks guys again &amp; Good luck</p>
