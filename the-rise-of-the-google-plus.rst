After the lunch of Google Plus beta, folks over the internet specially
Twitter start to write some comments about How Google Plus is awesome,
it is a Facebook killer, Facebook is doomed, and it has cool features of
Facebook and Twitter.

But for me I feel like it’s the success after the failure of `Google
Wave <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave>`__, and how inspiring
from Google to try again after this epic failure, me and `Amr
Eldib <http://twitter.com/#!/AmrEldib>`__ had small conversation over
Twitter about if it inspiring because it’s from Google or not, I feel
it’s but Amr feels not, I understand his point but still inspiring also

The spark:

|the begining of the conversation|

The conversation (from bottom to up):

|Me&Amr conversation|

So folks What do you think? Do you like Google Plus? Is it Facebook
killer?

Feel free to leave your answer in comments or on Twitter just mention me
