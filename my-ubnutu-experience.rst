| Hello Folks,
| Yesterday I discovered that you can install Ubuntu Linux OS from the
  Windows with Wubi application without all Linux headache
  (Partitioning, Bootloader, etc.), it'll just added in add/remove
  programs you can reuit simplemove like any windows application just
  that simple.
| Some posts said that Clean Ubuntu install is more performance than the
  from Windows, but for beginners the recommended that Windows one.
| Q:What i can do to install the Ubuntu from Windows installation?
| A:it's quit simple just follow the steps:
|     Step1: Download the ISO Ubuntu version
  [`link <http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download>`__].
|     Step2: Mount the ISO image in any Virtual CD/DVD tool (like:
  DemonTool, PowerISO, etc.).
|     Setp3: Double Click on the CD to run the Autorun and choose
  Install inside Windows.

|     Step4: Choose the drive you want to install Ubuntu inside it
  (don't worry it will never format or change the file system), and the
  size you want to assign to Ubuntu (recommended 8GB), Username and
  Password (is required), and press Install.
