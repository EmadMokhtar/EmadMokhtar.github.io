Next year, I realized the priority of buying a notebook to start
developing in mobile way.

So I start reading reviews and do some visits to local computer stores,
at last I decide the best machine which meet budget/performance criteria
is HP Pavilion DV5z-1030ee
[`Review <http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=4486>`__],
with powerful new AMD Puma system, but sadly I discovered that HP
Pavilion machine has a very very poor battery-life; at first it stand
for 2 hours with power-saver setting plus the Windows Vista power
consuming using 6-cells battery, but now I hardly reach 1:45 hours with
Windows 7; and if I buy the 12-cell battery add some money to gain some
battery life is still small time period to gain it reach 4:30 ~ 5:00
hours for 12-cells battery.

Some brand like Lenovo, Apple, and Dell you can get more than 2:00 hours
with 6-cells battery, why HP can't do what other can?, is this some
economic way to increase the profit.

The machine has some Pros.

-  Dedicated Graphics card ATI Radeon HD 3450 plus HD 3200 on board.
-  The keyboard is the same they used in old apple's macbook, and it's
   very good for writing fast.
-  Excellent screen brightness.
-  Some fancy HP features eSata, firewire, and HDMI ports.
