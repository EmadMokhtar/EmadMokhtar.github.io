Hello ppl,

Seesmic for Windows is the first native windows twitter client, they
announce it in PDC09, and in last MIX10 they announced the substitution
of this application which called Seesmic Desktop, this app is based on
Microsoft Sliverlight Technology, and the UI and UX is amazing and I
love it.

Now one day I faced a problem that my twitter list timeline in never
updated automatically, you must update it manually every time you want
to check it.

So I found a wonderful solution for this problem, first thing the
problem only on the list you created on Twitter or List you followed,
then you can solve this problem by creating lists inside the Seesmic
application itself and everything will work perfectly.

Here's an example:

Note: they solved and upgrade a lot of features on Seesmin Desktop, so
wait for it.
