In November 2009 I decided to change my life from unhealthy to healthy
lifestyle and lose weight to be healthy person, and this was a big and
hard decision to make it's like paradigm shifting so that I should be
careful with every step I take and analyze what to do next and how to it
right.

### My Journey step:  

Â 

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">First step</span> I went to
nutrition doctor rather than going to gym like most of Egyptian men do,
which all they do is burn fat and left some weights but still eating
junk food, which I think it's an awful thing to do, because you solve
one part of the puzzle and left the other parts unsolved.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second step</span> start to
love healthy food and walk for long durations and distances, but I did
this step in baby steps style, which made it a habit rather than
something to do to lose weight, for example I start to walk for small
distance if there's no transportation to it, or if this distance will
take 10 minutes to reach OK then walk rather than ride a transportation,
and Thanks for my iPod, I love walking while listing to my favorite
music, and right now I'm working on running, I hope I'll make habit also
:D

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third step</span> is mastering
what's to eat and what's not to eat? After 3 or 4 months on diet I start
to understand what is healthy food? How to cook it in home? And I
learned how to make it perfect healthy food (I'll define it later), and
this's what makes me love healthy food.

The intelligent thing to do is to know how to cook the perfect healthy
food, and its hard thing to accomplish on the first diet days, but keep
on and you'll.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have a definition for 3 kind
of food which is (IMHO):  
</span>

1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Healthy Food:</span> Food
    usually looks awful and has bad taste, but its health and gives you
    the energy in need.
2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unhealthy Food (Junk
    Food):</span> Food usually looks nice and taste good, but gives you
    unnecessary fat and calories.
3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perfect Healthy
    Food:</span> Food usually looks nice and taste good, it's like
    combination of healthy food and junk food, and this kind of food is
    very useful when you're in diet.

My journey in losing weight (form 160 Kg to 110 Kg till now) was too
damn hard but the benefits was huge, all my back and knee pains gone,
and I'm feeling that I'm very light even sometimes when I'm walking
people think I'm running, but actually it's brisk walking.

### Some Advices:  

-   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nutrition Doctor:</span>
    Go to nutrition doctor, and please be honest with him, if he ask
    about your eating habits tell him everything , and during diet if
    there's something wrong tell him next visit and he/she will solve
    this problem, and he/she will make some blood tests to check your
    health status and will try to heal you, like my doctor she's found
    out the I'd <span
    style="font-family: Segoe UI; font-size: 10pt;">Anemia and she heal
    it within 2 months.</span>
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drink:</span> Try to drink
    a lot, drink a lot of water, tea, coffee, herbals, non-alcoholic
    beer, diet soda, and skimmed milk, It's helps you to avoid the
    hunger feeling, trust me it's works even sometimes I feel like I'm
    drinking more that eating :D.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diet Plan:</span> Try to
    stick with you nutrition doctor diet plan.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Walk, walk, walk:</span>
    It's very important thing to do during diet, walk whenever it can
    be, park your car 10 minutes away from your work so you'll walk for
    20 minutes every day, take stairs if you can like in malls
    for example.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Meal:</span> In diet
    plan there's a one free meal per week, eat it whenever you want but
    don't make it's time static, take it when you want to eat or miss
    junk food; during diet this meal is very special because you eat
    whatever you like.
-   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Frustrations:</span> If
    you measure your weight and find out that it's increasing don't
    frustrate it's not a big deal keep on diet and you'll lose it, just
    keep persisting, and keep negative thoughts away, and remember
    you're breaking a habit and this's a very hard thing to do but
    not impossible.
-   <div>

    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sugar:</span> Stop using
    white and brown sugar and use fruit sugar instead, it's useful for
    diet and [diabetic people, I use
    pocket]()[CANDEREL](http://www.canderel.co.uk/) sugar.

weight is between 95 and 85.
