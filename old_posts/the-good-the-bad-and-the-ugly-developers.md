I saw very interesting tweet from [**Glenn
Block**](https://twitter.com/#%21/gblock) [@gblock](https://twitter.com/#!/gblock)
and this remind me with something I read in [The Clean
Coder](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)
book from Uncle Bob Martin, which talks about professional developer and
what to do to be a professional. Uncle Bob describe the professional
developer takes the responsibility of his mistakes, it’s true because if
he take this responsibility, he’ll learn from his mistakes and learn how
he made it in first place, so he can avoid it next time, even if he make
this mistake again he knows how to solve it quick and clean.

Personally I learn like this and it’s teach you the lesson very well.

Dear readers please give me your feedback/opinion about this subject.
