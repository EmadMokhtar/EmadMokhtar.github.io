After the lunch of Google Plus beta, folks over the internet specially
Twitter start to write some comments about How Google Plus is awesome,
it is a Facebook killer, Facebook is doomed, and it has cool features of
Facebook and Twitter.

But for me I feel like it’s the success after the failure of [Google
Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave), and how inspiring from
Google to try again after this epic failure, me and [Amr
Eldib](http://twitter.com/#!/AmrEldib) had small conversation over
Twitter about if it inspiring because it’s from Google or not, I feel
it’s but Amr feels not, I understand his point but still inspiring also
