</font>is Egyptian usergroup which gather for one reason, they
interested with .Net Technology, they lunched in December 11,2007 at
Microsoft Egypt building in Smart Village, I was lucky to be there
to feel and experience my first offline usergroup session/gathering and
see a lot of geeks under on roof, some of them was Microsofter “like
googler” such as Stephen Forte, Mohammad Wahby, and Ahmed Adel.

I attended most of their Monthly gathering and Techday, it’s wonderful
experience to see a lot of people meet in one place to share, discuss,
and learn new IT technology, and I was dream to be a part of this
phenomenal group.

**<u>Group Members:</u>**

1.  Remon Zakria (President)
2.  Ahmed Ramy.
3.  Mohammed M. Mosa.
4.  Lames Afifiy.
5.  Shimaa Hamdan.
6.  Karim Wahba.

**<u>My Experience with Dotnetwork:</u>**

Every gathering or techday i attend the dream grow more and more, until
one day at October’09 gathering which focused on Silverlight 3.0, I made
my fist contact with Ahmed Ramy and we have small chat, and some day
they call for Volunteers to help them organizing the CairoCodeCamp, I
make my mind an said this’s my chance to be part of this group even if
it for short period there’s nothing I can loss.

I send mail to submit myself as volunteer, and Karim Wahba call me for
interview, they accepted me, and we had our first meeting, and now I’m a
member of a wonderful group of volunteers I feel enormous pleasure with
them and I hope we do it perfectly Inshaa Allah.

See You Soon at [CairoCodeCamp](http://www.cairocodecamp.com/), Enjoy
it.
