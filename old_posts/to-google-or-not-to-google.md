To Google or not to Google? this is not even a question, [Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/about/) wrote an article about
[Googler Developers or search engine
developer](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AmIReallyADeveloperOrJustAGoodGoogler.aspx)
I found it very interesting because he’s talking about developers whom
using Google to search for a solution and copy and paste it. Irony some
developers aren’t able to Google the solution as well, I always believe
that understand what is the problem is its half solution.

Then understand what is the problem is a skill that some developers
missing it, even [Oren
Eini](http://ayende.com/blog/162849/stories-from-the-interview-room)
wrote about some developers in interview have full internet access and
can’t even solve their problems.

AM I Googler Developer or not?
------------------------------

Sure I am, I Google about the solution online, actually most if not all
of my technical resources are online [Google](http://www.google.com/),
[Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com),
[GitHub](http://www.GitHub.com), [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/),
online documentations, [my blog](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/), other
developers blogs, etc.., but what I’m doing is not just search for a
code to copy and paste it in order get things done, absolutely not I’m
search for a solution, not any solution, no I’m searching/Goolging for
the best and the simplest solution and if I can’t find it, I’ll take the
best one from what I found and start to enhance or modify it to be in my
opinion the best.

I wrote a blog post about [How to add image zoom to ASP.NET WebForms
GridView](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/2013/05/add-image-zoom-to-asp-net-webform-gridview/)
and it has few lines of code, before I got this solution I Goolged it,
and found many solution which were in my opinion complex for simple
task, they’ve many lines of code. So I thought of creating my best
solution, after that I wrote it to give people and myself a simple
solution online.

In the other hands Rick Strahl also wrote [his thoughts about Scott
Hanselman
article](http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2013/Aug/24/The-Search-Engine-Developer?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+RickStrahl+%28Rick+Strahl%27s+WebLog%29),
and in his article he asked one question

And for me to be honest I’m not sure I could as well.

What I can do?
--------------

Hanselman gave great points in his articles but in comments, someone
wrote exactly what I was thinking  after reading the article.

When you search/Google for a solution you’ll read other’s code and this
is a way or learning which learn from strength and weakness of everyone,
how they wrote this code, why they wrote it like this whether it’s clean
or not.

Be median
---------

In bottom line what I think is be a median don’t always depend on Google
and don’t always depend on your memory, choose what is better for your
situation, even choosing is a skill, try to develop your skills don’t
depend on your old ones or others.
