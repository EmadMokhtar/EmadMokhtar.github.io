us about what they did/felt when they tried to unplug/disconnect from
the Technical/Technology world, I decided to try it myself, so I had one
extra day in this weekend with my family as decided to take one day trip
away from the crowded city & go to the far south of Kuwait where modern
life seems far far away.

I took this chance & tried to stay away from checking my Twitter &
Facebook, what’s new in the .NET world & technology, what do twitter
buddies tweet about, checking my emails, reading this or reading that ,
the urge to learn new things whether they’re  technical things or things
about life, if we published the new episode of
[**EgyGeeks**](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/ct.ashx?id=2b5344cc-16c5-48c9-97fb-9a2a6f0741a3&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.egygeeks.net)or
not, what’re the listeners’ feedbacks about the new episode & what’s
happening in the world.

So I started to focus on engaging with my family & specially with my
beloved one, to sit & talk with them more than before, to have more
conversations about our life & future together, it’s a very good feeling
when they start to know you & you know them more than before because you
always sit in front of your machine with this big dual 19-inch screens
or even in front of 3.5 inch smart phone’s screen,  to start talking &
dealing with them, it’s great thing to do& believe me the world &
twitter will stay the same nobody is going to change it for one day.

I’m sure you’ll miss your geeky mood & the world you live when you’re in
this mood but believe me one day away from this world & focusing on
other important things, after one day away you’ll back more productive,
motivated, full of power & energy & relaxed.
