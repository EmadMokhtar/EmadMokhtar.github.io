I’ve got many questions from young developers who want to learn
programming and be professionals, I thought of writing this article to
give them a glance about how I learn software stuff. I want to tell you
I’m still learning and I’ll always pursuit knowledge and being
professional software craftsman, and you should consider the same,
believe me if you stop learning, you’ll become outdated in this field,
and you’ll suck, I met developers with big fat years of experience but
they are outdated since 5 years and they can’t go with new technologies
anymore, ask any doctor or lawyer and he’ll tell you this craft is about
leaning and learning and gaining knowledge.

Learning development is separated into two parts:

1.  Dealing with human.
2.  Dealing with computer.

Dealing with human
==================

Dealing with human like dealing with client, don’t tell me I just want
to code dude, no sometime if not all of the time you have to deal with
the clients, think of it as you have your own company you’re
entrepreneur now, Do you want to write code only? or you want to create
success product by gathering the right requirements from clients and
work on them, and then deliver this product, How will you do this if you
want to write code only?

Dealing with human is dealing with team, crap again dude I want to put
my headphones listen to music, go to the zone, and write code, nah good
developers are good team player, to help your team-mate in the project,
raise flag when you have a problem, or peer programming, you must have
dealing with humans skill.

You’ll learn these skills during your work, I don’t have a screen cast,
video training, or book…oh wait wait actually I know some books taking
about this:

Dealing with computer:
======================

Dealing with computer is programming, In my opinion programming learning
is in two stages, first learn how to code, and second leaning  how to
write code right or how to produce clean code. You’ll learn well if you
learn from your mistakes,  personally I learnt from my mistakes, every
time I made a mistake I was very sad and in the beginning I made a lot
of silly mistakes, please be passionate, never give up, keep going, and
learn from it, I know it’s so hard in the beginning but you’ll love what
you’re doing.

Craftsmanship:
==============

> **Software craftsmanship** is an approach to software development that
> emphasizes the coding skills of the software developers themselves. It
> is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the
> mainstream software industry, including the prioritization of
> financial concerns over developer accountability.
>
> [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship)

In Clean Code book Martin Bob aka Uncle Bob wrote craftsmanship is
separated into two parts Knowledge and Experience. Knowledge is the
learn how to, and Experience is using knowledge to build something, so
learn and practice by doing something, if you can’t build something with
what you just learn you can build something as side project, [this
slides](https://speakerdeck.com/sachag/side-projects) encourage me to do
some side projects

Books:
------

Books for developers are like water for fish, you need to read, read,
and read. Technology focused books like ASP.NET books there are many of
them in market but make sure you pick nice ones first, personally I
search for a book using Amazon read reviews and boom I pick on and read
it. There are books I recommended but it’s not technology focused it
focus in making you better developer:
