Today when I was waiting for the band of Tanora Show to get started, I
wrote this poetry for someone special.

<span style="font-size:14pt">She SEO my life  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She turns my 0'z to 1'z  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She nudges my feelings  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She is my RSS of my life  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">If you Google my heart you'll find her  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She is a Hashtag of my soul  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She is a Love entity in my HeartDB  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She is system file of my memory  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She is a Silverlight of my future  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She autocomplete my thoughts  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">She ReadyBoost my motivation  
</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">And I Favorite/Bookmark here :D</span>
