It's a time management system; It's simple, and very productive.

Pomodoro is tomato in some language "Google it and see", it's inspired
by the kitchen timer that take a shape of Tomato, and the timing of the
technique is based on the kitchen timer.

How to use/implement Pomodoro Technique?
========================================

It's very simple and easy to use, there's a number of apps implement it,
even you can use a kitchen times unless you're in your company office
:D.

Let's start explain how to use it:

-   Allocate a certain task you want to get it done.
-   Do it for 25 minutes.
-   And take a 5 minutes break.
-   Repeat step 2 & 3 4-times.
-   And then take 30 minutes beak.
-   <div>

    And start from step 2 again, and if you finish the task start from
    the beginning.

    </div>

Focus Booster is my favorite pomodoro technique app, it's developed over
Adobe Air so it is cross-platform, and it's free.

It's very simple just run the application and press the green play
button and the timer will decreased until it reach 00:00 and the green
bar increased and change its color to the degrees of red (orange and
red).

When it reached 00:00, it'll fire tiny alarm to remind you that's your
break time.

During break time the timer reset to 05:00 and decreased to 00:00 and
the bar also decreased with it; when the timer reach 00:00 the same tiny
alarm will fire to remind you to start you job/30 min break.

What I can do in the break time?
================================

Anything you are like to do in your free time and not related to the
task, you can check Twitter, Facebook, Emails, or even read regular blog
posts, go out to get fresh air, go check your family, make your drink,
take a shower, etcâ€¦

For me I like to make my coffee, go pray in the mosque, in the 30 min
break I talk a walk, or sometimes check my Emails, Facebook, or Twitter.

So folks I wish this technique helps you in Get Things Done in more
productive way; and remember Time is very important thing or our life
actually it's our life, so spend it wisely.
