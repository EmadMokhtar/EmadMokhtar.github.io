Hello Folks,  
  
Yesterday I discovered that you can install Ubuntu Linux OS from the
Windows with Wubi application without all Linux headache (Partitioning,
Bootloader, etc.), it'll just added in add/remove programs you can reuit
simplemove like any windows application just that simple.  
Some posts said that Clean Ubuntu install is more performance than the
from Windows, but for beginners the recommended that Windows one.  
  
Q:What i can do to install the Ubuntu from Windows installation?  
A:it's quit simple just follow the steps:  
    Step1: Download the ISO Ubuntu version
\[[link](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download)\].  
    Step2: Mount the ISO image in any Virtual CD/DVD tool (like:
DemonTool, PowerISO, etc.).  
    Setp3: Double Click on the CD to run the Autorun and choose Install
inside Windows.

    Step4: Choose the drive you want to install Ubuntu inside it (don't
worry it will never format or change the file system), and the size you
want to assign to Ubuntu (recommended 8GB), Username and Password (is
required), and press Install.

and Boom you have Ubuntu on your PC.
