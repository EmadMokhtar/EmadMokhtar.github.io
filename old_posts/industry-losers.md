I keeping asking myself one question and wondering Why are we in Middle
East industry losers? Why when we are trying to enter the industry with
good quality product we totally fail? Why are we always consumers? What
is the problem? For god sake what is wrong?  
I've start to draw a picture of what is the problem, but this picture is
not a complete one. Please readers do not get me wrong I'm not writing
this post to criticize, no I'm writing this post to identify the problem
and I always believe the first step to solve a problem is to admit there
is a problem.  
The picture is we are directing our power, money, and resources in wrong
way, hmmm interesting How? Stockholders/Employer think when they reduce
number of resources they will increase the profit and they do not
consider the quality of the product, they are creating the product with
minimum number of resource and budget and this will produce low quality
and cheap product; in other word they are profit focus.

To elaborate the idea I will take Cars Industry as example to illustrate
the problem, in car industry there are standard processes to be done in
order to get the normal quality car like, collect raw material,
designing, and assembly. let's take one of them which is <span
style="text-decoration: underline">Designing</span> and make comparison
between what will be done in Middle East and other part of the world
where they take care of the quality of the product let's say Asian.

###### <span style="font-weight: normal">Designing</span>

To design a new car model takes from three to five years, designers
predict What are people love to ride after three years? What will be
public taste after three years? designer start drawing the model with
help of computer equipment to help the designer experts to check if this
design will be accepted in public, after the design pass this step here
comes the aerodynamic engineers to review aerodynamics flow, to do
feasibility tests, and crash tests. This what will be done in high
quality focus industry, but in Middle East what will be done is just
think about how to produce a car with minimum cost and maximum profit
regardless the quality, lifetime, and the design; all what we need is
hit and run sales, sale the car to the costumer, get the money, and we
all done mission accomplished.

##### <span style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion:</span></span>

Unfortunately if you look at the software industry in Middle East you
will find this what is happening, I hope and dream about change the
industry and the way of thinking to get this industry more better and
solve this problem.

I want a [Silicon Valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley)
in Middle Ease, I want Microsoft, Google, IBM, JetBrains, RedGate,
Telerik, DevExpress,â€¦..etc. Middle Ease Edition, I want this bar to get
higher in Middle East.
