Hello folks,

Just few days and the wonderful CairoCodeCamp event will start, so warm
your engine and clear your brain for the enormous amount of
technical information at CCC.

**<u>What is CairoCodeCamp?</u>**

CCC is big Technical event with 20+ speakers and 40+ different session,
all talk about Microsoft’s new technology like [ASP.NET
MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/whatisaspmvc/), [C\#
4.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_4.0), [ASP.NET
4.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET), etc; it’s substitute for
Microsoft EDC/MDC aka Egyptian Developer Conference which canceled since
2008, and Microsoft give hand for some usergroup community to implement
it, this usergroup called [Dotnetwork aka
.network](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/2010/02/14/Who-Is-Dotnetwork.aspx).

There will be a lot of information of .Net Framework 4 because Microsoft
will lunch it soon, they lunch the RC1 edition 2 weeks before the event,
so stay tune and defragment your brain; and there’ll be a big challenge
between 2 ORM tools (NHibernate and Microsoft
Entity Framework) sessions, wow i hope there will not be blood.

**<u>What I must do before the event?</u>**

Everyone want to enjoy this wonderful event, so from my experience if
you follow these steps it’ll be perfect event for you:

1.  **Join CCC Website:** It’s the most important step, just go to CCC
    website and fill the form, you can’t attend the event if you don’t
    register online \[[Registration
    link](http://www.cairocodecamp.com/Profile/Registration/Default.aspx)\]
2.  **Order Tickets as Group:** if you want to save some money and you
    know group will attend with you order tickets as group to save the
    shipping fees \[[Tickets
    link](http://www.cairocodecamp.com/AboutTickets.aspx)\]
3.  **Check Your Mail:** Make sure you check your registered email
    daily, because they send news and alerts ASAP.
4.  **Create Sessions Map:** [Download the
    agenda](http://www.cairocodecamp.com/Agenda/CairoCodeCamp10%20Agenda.pdf)
    and make your mind which sessions you’ll attend, and write your map
    on a piece of paper and make sure it with you during the event.
5.  **Come Early:** the more early you will be the more relaxing you’ll
    be, you’ll avoid the crawled registration queue and something sort
    of that; and just focus on the information at the session.
6.  **Plan For Your** **Transportation:** there’ll be buses from & to
    GUC, so make sure you know where the buses will be and if you come
    with car know how to drive to GUC to avoid arrives late.
7.  **Notebook:** bring small note or notebook and pen so you can write
    any notes to remember after the event.
8.  **Make Connections:** the best of all this event is gathering people
    with same ideas, so don’t be shy and make friends/connections.
9.  **Wearing The Name Tag:** please wear your name tag after
    finishing the registration, because the GUC security and Dotnetwork
    stuff know you’re attender of the event and everybody know your name
    so that the step no. 7 will be easier.
10. **Closing Session:** make sure to attend the closing session because
    there’ll be a lot of
    [gifts](http://www.cairocodecamp.com/Giveaways.aspx) and for
    sure FUN.
11. **Follow the Dotnetwork Twitter:** follow Dotnetwork twitter account
