a .NET developer and to be specific I’m a web developer who use .NET
framework and .NET stack to create web application (Web App), and
nowadays I’m learning ASP.NET MVC to move from WebForms world to MVC
world, but in future I’m planning to get out of my comfort zone again
and get out of .NET world and try the open source software (OSS) world,
I’ve attended many sessions for [GDG Kuwait](http://gdgkuwait.com/)
which is Google Developers Group located in Kuwait and the only
developer group in here with .NET/C\# experience and it’s full of
enthusiasm developers.

When I will take this leap/paradigm shift I will take it for real, let
me explain what I mean by that. What I’m planning is learning [Ruby on
Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), maybe you want to learn
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) but when you will, please don’t try to
stick to Microsoft world, don’t be afraid to get out of your comfort
zone, please don’t use [Node.js tools for Visual
Studio](https://nodejstools.codeplex.com/), or [Python tools for Visual
Studio](https://pytools.codeplex.com/), or [Ruby In Steel
Developer](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Products/sapphire-ide/article/ruby-in-steel-developer-overview)
these Frameworks works great with Linux operating systems so learn how
to use Linux operating system like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/),
then how to install/prepare the environment, and then how to use tools
to start develop and learn the framework, get out there you will not
learn these frameworks by using Visual Studio.
