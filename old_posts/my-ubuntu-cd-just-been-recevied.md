Today I had my ordered Ubuntu CD from Canonical, it's pretty awesome to
feel that there's connection between you and some Huge Computer Software
Company like Canonical, Google, or Microsoft.

There's a pharagraph on the back of CD cover

**Share the spirit**, Ubuntu is an ancient African word which means
'humanity to others'. If you know someone who would enjoy Ubuntu, please
pass it on and share the spirit. So I feel it, do you feel it ?
