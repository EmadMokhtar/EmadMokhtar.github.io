If your lucky and joined [Microsoft
WebsiteSpark](https://www.google.com.kw/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fweb%2Fwebsitespark%2F&ei=zdQAU7vaAYGAywO1t4DYCQ&usg=AFQjCNHsc6se-oydHtPU25GIJRsdzNy7iw&sig2=EpZq6LmeJ3vvC2rAlwVj2Q&bvm=bv.61535280,d.bGQ)
program like mine you’ll have an access to most of Microsoft
professional tools like Visual studio Professional edition, but
unfortunately they’ve closed the program, but don’t worry there’re free
tools you can use which are:

1.  [**Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for
    Web**](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40747)
    it’s free version of great Microsoft IDE Visual Studio, it’s free
    but it can run unit tests and connect to TFS *(connecting to TFS is
    neat feature and you’ll know why when mention tools number 3).*
2.  [**Microsoft WebMatrix
    3**](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286266)**:** it’s light
    web development tool support ASP.NET, PHP, and Node.js.
3.  [**Visual Studio
    Online**](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137&clcid=0x409)**:**
    it’s Microsoft Team Foundation Server on cloud, imagine you can have
    the full ALM (source control, build server, test server, bug
    tracking, and etc.) system like TFS online free for you and up to
    5 users.
4.  [**Microsoft SQL Server 2012
    Express**](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062)**:**
    it’s free version of Microsoft Database engine and if you choose to
    download and install *Express with Advanced Services* you’ll get
    Express Tools, Reporting Services, and Full Text Search with
    Database Engine for free. You need a database engine on your
    development machine during development as you need to store some
    data somewhere.

Now you know what are free tools you need to develop ASP.NET
application, let’s see what you need after developing the application.

Hosting
-------

There are three types of hosting:

1.  **Shared web hosting service:** Host your website on a server that
    shared between you and other customers, this kind of hosting manger
    through Web Panels, and application can be deployed using Web Deploy
    using Visual Studio.
2.  **Virtual private server (VPS):** Host your website on virtual
    server and it’s completely for you only, but it runs on
    virtual environment.
3.  **Dedicated hosting service:** Host your website on physical server,
    like you’re leasing real physical server.
4.  **Cloud hosting Services:** Setup and configure your server and
    it’ll be up and run within minutes. and the beauty of the cloud is
    you pay only for you use.

I’ve listed hosting types from lower to higher cost, if you want to
start small try share web hosting and after having money you can invest
in VPS or even more cloud hosting on Microsoft Azure.

License
-------

Microsoft licenses are confused subject for us, but don’t worry you’re
web developer and web are free, so when you developed ASP.NET
application and you want host your application on web, don’t worry the
hosting plan include software licenses for .NET Framework, Windows
Server,  SQL Server, and many software you’ll need or maybe you won’t,
so please don’t worry about the license unless you’ll host you’re
application on premises.
