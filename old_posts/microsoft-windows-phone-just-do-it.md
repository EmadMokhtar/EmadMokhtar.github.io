In the beginning of 2013 my HTC Desire HD screen broke and I had to buy
new phone, I did my investigation and found Nokia Lumia 920 is the best
one for me, I bought it with the risk of Microsoft Windows Phone is not
mature enough and it has apps less than Android and iOS. I tool the same
risk when I bought HTC Desire HD, Android wasn’t mature enough and has
apps less than iOS, but Google was super fast to develop its mobile OS
and take big leap in mobile market and attract developers to its
platform.

Microsoft Windows Phone has many missing features and these features
include simple basic feature “I’ll mention them later” but if Microsoft
Windows Phone didn’t accelerate its development and listen to its
customer, it’ll lose them and it’ll lose the tiny market share it has.
Many apps are missing in Microsoft Windows Phone and I don’t know why
companies aren’t developing their apps for Microsoft Windows Phone, for
example instagram they didn’t develop its app but “ONE” developer
developed an app called
[6tag](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/6tag/7d795cdf-fb1b-4bdf-8f5e-76eb19f7079e)
which is better than instagram app on Android and iOS, and after that
[they announced Windows Phone instagram will be
released](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/22/4863048/instagram-official-windows-phone-app)
which I’ll not use, then instegram was able to develop its app on
Windows Phone from the beginning so why is so late?

   One day when I’m Googling “Yes goolging not bing” I discovered
Microsoft Windows Phone has [User Voice
page](http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/) which is full of missing
feature I want, finally I’m not alone most of Microsoft Windows Phone
missing the same features, Why Microsoft is not listing to us, we are
users and we have missing features in common.

Ironic reply from the admin of User Voice page makes me feel they don’t
respect our voice, BTW this feature implemented in GDR3 update but still
I don’t like the reply.

### What I am missing?

<ol>
<li>
**Device vibrate while ringing**, now it’ll vibe for 5 seconds and play
the ringtone, after the ringtone is done it’ll vibe for 5 seconds again
and play the ringtone, and keep doing that.[![vibrate and

</li>
<li>
Where is **Notifications Center**, Google invented this feature in
Android and Apple understood how much this is a great and needy feature
and they implemented it too, but unfortunately Microsoft
didn’t.[![Notifications](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Notifications_thumb.png "Notifications"){width="623"

</li>
<li>
**Custom sound for email, SMS, etc**., now you can only select built-in
sounds for those and no application notification sound
settings.[![Custom

height="352"}](http://www.emadmokhtar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Customringtones.png)

</li>
<li>
**File Manager**, yes iOS don’t have this feature but Android has and
it’s great one.[![File

</li>
<li>
**Close an app from multi-tasking**, if you hold the back button
multi-tasking will appears and if you want to close on of these apps you
can’t.[![close multi

</li>
1.  Note: This feature implemented in GDR3 update.

<li>
**multi-sound level settings**, If you’re listening to music or watching
a video and you decrease the sound volume, you will find that ringtone
volume is decreased as well, this can lead to missing called and I did
before.[![Sound

</li>
