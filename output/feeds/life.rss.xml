&lt;p&gt;In November 2009 I decided to change my life from unhealthy to healthy lifestyle and lose weight to be healthy person, and this was a big and hard decision to make it's like paradigm shifting so that I should be careful with every step I take and analyze what to do next and how to it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My Journey steps:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step, I went to nutrition doctor rather than going to gym like most of Egyptian men do, which all they do is burn fat and left some weights but still eating junk food, which I think it's an awful thing to do, because you solve one part of the puzzle and left the other parts unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second step start to love healthy food and walk for long durations and distances, but I did this step in baby steps style, which made it a habit rather than something to do to lose weight, for example I start to walk for small distance if there's no transportation to it, or if this distance will take 10 minutes to reach OK then walk rather than ride a transportation, and Thanks for my iPod, I love walking while listing to my favorite music â€¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2010 14:43:00 +0300</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.emadmokhtar.com,2010-07-12:/my-journey-with-diet.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
