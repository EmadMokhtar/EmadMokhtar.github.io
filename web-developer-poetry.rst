Today when I was waiting for the band of Tanora Show to get started, I
wrote this poetry for someone special.

She SEO my life

She turns my 0'z to 1'z

She nudges my feelings

She is my RSS of my life

If you Google my heart you'll find her

She is a Hashtag of my soul

She is a Love entity in my HeartDB

She is system file of my memory

She is a Silverlight of my future

She autocomplete my thoughts

She ReadyBoost my motivation

And I Favorite/Bookmark here :D
