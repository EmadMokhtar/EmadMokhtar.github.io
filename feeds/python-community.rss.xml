&lt;p&gt;November 2015 &lt;a href="http://emadmokhtar.com/net-developer-comfort-zone.html#net-developer-comfort-zone"&gt;I left my comfort zone, and I started my journey with Python&lt;/a&gt;, it was not an easy start. I was a Windows/Microsoft guy, I was using Microsoft Visual Studio on a daily basis, and Windows was my primary OS.  I switched to macOS and Pycharm; I picked these to make my transition easier than using Linux (Ubuntu) and Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2 months of figuring out what are virtualenv, pip, python version, and environment variable. I started another milestone of how to write a pythonic code while that I went to &lt;a href="http://emadmokhtar.com/djangocon-europe-2016-me-and-django-sprints.html#djangocon-europe-2016-me-and-django-sprints"&gt;DjangoCon&lt;/a&gt;, and I saw how awesome this community is. WOW ü§ó, this community is very welcoming for newcomers, and since this day I'm in ‚ù§Ô∏è with this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like someone said to me "You are staying because of people not because of  the language." Indeed, the community is excellent üëçüèª, and it is what makes this language impressive and always adopting the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all human beings in this community form leaders to the starters (welcome BTW üòâ), thank you for being a part of this community and making this community.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Emad Mokhtar</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 12:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.emadmokhtar.com,2018-09-23:/thank-you-python-community.html</guid><category>Python</category></item></channel></rss>
